# ShadowShell

## Why I Started Creating ShadowShell

I wanted a way to store my personal functions, aliases, and plans all in one place. With ShadowShell, 
I can easily backup my settings and install them on any machine by simply cloning my repository and running the script. 
It transforms any PC into my personal environment within minutes, bringing along all my custom configurations and software aliases effortlessly.
